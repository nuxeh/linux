System-EDP Reactive Capping:

Required properties:
- compatible: "nvidia,tegra124-sysedp_reactive_capping"
- nvidia,max_capping_mw: This defines the maximum allowed power for this consumer
  in milliwatts.
- nvidia,step_alarm_mw: When the interrupt is triggered, increase the consumer's
  power by this amount in milliwatts.
- nvidia,step_relax_mw: After relax_ms time since the last interrupt has fired,
  reduce this consumer's required power by this amount in milliwatts.
- nvidia,relax_ms: This defines the delay in milliseconds after an interrupt
  triggers before relaxing this consumer's power requirements.
- interrupt-parent: This points to the parent device that will own the
  translation of the interrupt lines.
- interrupts: This provides the mapping to the parent which will translate
  the interrupt into the virtual irq value and flags used by
  request_threaded_irq(). Only 1 interrupt (2 values) should be defined.

Optional properties:
- nvidia,threshold_warning: If used, this node provides a message to be printed
  when this consumer's interrupt gets trigerred.

Required sub-nodes:
- sysedpc: This node contains one subnode which needs one property defined:

Require parameter inside sysedpc subnode
  - nvidia,name: This is the name of the sysedp consumer defined

Example:
	sysedp_reactive_capping@1 {
		compatible = "nvidia,tegra124-sysedp_reactive_capping";
		nvidia,max_capping_mw = <15000>;
		nvidia,step_alarm_mw = <1000>;
		nvidia,step_relax_mw = <500>;
		nvidia,relax_ms = <250>;
		nvidia,threshold_warning = "WARNING - SYSTEM Voltage Droop detected, please refer to the Power management application note";
		interrupt-parent = <&soctherm>;
		interrupts = <1 0x2002>;

		sysedpc {
			nvidia,name = "voltmon_oc1";
		}
	};
