Tegra AGIC Interrupt Controller Bindings
----------------------------------------

AGIC is based on generic interrupt controller ARM IP GIC400. The
GIC-400 complies to AMBA AXI4 protocol and Version 2 of the ARM
GIC Architecture Specification. The GIC-400 implements the GICv2
Security Extension.

Required properties:
 - compatible: should be set to "nvidia,tegra210-agic"
 - reg: should contain AGIC distributor and cpu interface base
   address
 - interrupt-controller: detect this node as an interrupt-controller
 - no-gic-extension: This gic is standalone int controller and does
   not have external interrupt controller to support.
 - not-per-cpu: This gic is shared between the CPU's and the adsp and
   does not provide per-cpu interface.

Example:
	agic-controller {
		compatible = "nvidia,tegra210-agic";
		interrupt-controller;
		no-gic-extension;
		not-per-cpu;
		reg = <0x0 0x702f9000 0x0 0x2000>,
		      <0x0 0x702fa000 0x0 0x2000>;
		interrupts = <0 102 0xf04>;
	};
