* MAX77620 Power management IC.

Required properties:
-------------------
- compatible: Must be "maxim,max77620".
- reg: I2C device address.
- interrupt-controller: MAX77620 has internal interrupt controller which takes the
  interrupt request from internal sub-blocks like RTC, regulators, GPIOs as well
  as external input.
- #interrupt-cells: Should be set to 2 for IRQ number and flags.
  The first cell is the IRQ number. IRQ numbers for different interrupt source
  of AS3722 are defined at dt-bindings/mfd/max77620.h
  The second cell is the flags, encoded as the trigger masks from binding document
	interrupts.txt, using dt-bindings/irq.

This device also support the power OFF and power reset of system.
Following properties are used for this purpose:
- maxim,system-pmic-power-off: Boolean, This device will be used for system
	power OFF. Host will issue i2c command to PMIC to power OFF system.
- maxim,system-pmic-power-reset: Boolean, This device will used for system
	power reset. Host will issue i2c command to PMIC to reset system.
- maxim,system-power-controller: Boolean, This device will be use as
	system power controller and used for power OFF and power reset
	of system. Host issue necessary command to PMIC.
- maxim,power-reset-gpio-states: Two dimensional array type, This property
	provides the option to set the PMIC GPIOs on desired state just
	before power OFF or power reset of system. Values are provided as
	follows:
		maxim,power-reset-gpio-states = <6 0
						7 1>;
		Means GPIO6 will set as LOW and GPIO7 will set as HIGH
		just before power OFF and reset of system.
