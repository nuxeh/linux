* Amlogic MesonX MMC controller

The highspeed MMC host controller on Amlogic SoCs provides an interface
for MMC, SD, SDIO and SDHC types of memory cards.

Supported maximum speeds are the ones of the eMMC standard 4.41 as well
as the speed of SD standard 2.0.

Required properties:
 - compatible : "amlogic,meson-mmc"
 - reg : mmc controller base registers
 - interrupts : mmc controller interrupt
 - clocks : phandle to SDIO clock provider

Optional properties:
 - meson,sdio-port : 0 for SDIO port A, 1 for SDIO port B. (default: 0)
 - for cd, bus-width and additional generic mmc parameters
   please refer to mmc.txt within this directory

Examples:
	- Within .dtsi:
	mmc0: mmc@c1108c20 {
		compatible = "amlogic,meson-mmc";
		reg = <0xc1108c20 0x20>;
		interrupts = <0 28 1>;
		clocks = <&clkc CLKID_CLK81>;
		status = "disabled";
	};

	- Within .dts:
	&mmc0 {
		status = "okay";
		pinctrl-0 = <&mmc0_sd_b_pins>;
		pinctrl-names = "default";
		meson,sdio-port = <1>;
		cd-gpios = <&gpio CARD_6 0>;
		cd-inverted;
	};
