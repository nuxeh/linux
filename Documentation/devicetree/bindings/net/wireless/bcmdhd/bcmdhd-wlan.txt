* bcmdhd-wlan devicetree bindings

This file documents the properties used by the bcmdhd-wlan driver.

Required properties:
- compatible : Must be "android,tegra-bcmdhd-wlan"

Optional properties:
- "wlan-pwr-gpio" is a gpio to power on/off wifi chip
- "wlan-rst-gpio" is a gpio to reset wifi chip
- "interrupts" is a wake on wireless gpio interrupt pin
- "edp-consumer-name" is required to populate wifi edp consumer name

Example:
bcmdhd_wlan {
	compatible = "android,tegra-bcmdhd-wlan";
	interrupt-parent = <&gpio>;
	interrupts = <165 0x14>;
	wlan-pwr-gpio = <&gpio TEGRA_GPIO(X, 7) 0>;
	wlan-rst-gpio = <&gpio TEGRA_GPIO(CC, 5) 0>;
	edp-consumer-name = "primary-wifi";
};

* bcmdhd2-wlan devicetree bindings

This file documents the properties used by the bcmdhd2-wlan driver.

Required properties:
- compatible : Must be "nvidia,tegra-bcmdhd2-wlan"

Optional properties:
- "wlan-pwr-gpio" is a gpio to power on/off wifi chip
- "wlan-rst-gpio" is a gpio to reset wifi chip
- "interrupts" is a wake on wireless gpio interrupt pin
- "edp-consumer-name" is required to populate wifi edp consumer name

Example:
bcm4329_wlan2_ {
	compatible = "nvidia,tegra-bcmdhd2-wlan";
	interrupt-parent = <&gpio>;
	interrupts = <165 0x14>;
	wlan-pwr-gpio = <&gpio TEGRA_GPIO(X, 7) 0>;
	wlan-rst-gpio = <&gpio TEGRA_GPIO(CC, 5) 0>;
	edp-consumer-name = "secondary-wifi";
};
