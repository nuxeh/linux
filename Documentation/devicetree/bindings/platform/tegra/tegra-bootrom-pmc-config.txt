The Tegra Bootrom has feature to send i2c commnds to device during boot.
This helps to set the desired rail voltage and any required configuration
on PMIC before system boot.

This driver provides the interface to make the list of command which bootrom
understand from the high level needs. User can provide the requiremets from DT
as the PMIC/device specific commands and driver translates this to PMC level
programming which bootrom reads and sends the command.

For more details, pelase refer bootrom DFD.

Here is the details of the device-tree bindings.
