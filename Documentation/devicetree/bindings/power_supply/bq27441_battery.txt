bq27441 battery
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Required properties :
 - compatible : Should contain "ti,bq27441".
 - ti,tz-name : Thermal zone name.
Optional properties :
 - ti,design-capacity : The designed battery capacity used for
   gauge's predictions. in mAh.
 - ti,design-energy : The designed battery energy. in mWh.
 - ti,taper-rate : The current threshold below which your charger
   IC is set to stop charging once it considers the battery to be
   full. in mA.
 - ti,terminate-voltage : Should be set to the minimum operating
   voltage of your system. This is the target where the gauge
   typically reports 0% capacity. in mV.
 - ti,v-at-chg-term : Voltage at charge termination. in mV.
 - ti,kernel-threshold-soc: Minimum SoC for kernel read from device.
        Bootloader jumps to kernel when SoC is more than this value.
        Driver make this SoC as 0% before reporting it to the framework.
 - ti,kernel-maximum-soc: Maximum SoC for kernel read from device.
        Kernel read maximum SoC from device for given battery. Kernel
        translate the SoC to 100% before reporting to framework if it
        reads equal/more than this value.
 - ti,enable-temp-prop:should enable temp prop if platform supports
        battery temp reading through fuel gauge chip or ADC channel.

Note:
Battery current monitoring:
	Driver supports the battery current monitoring through IIO interface
	and if platform supports it then following properties are required to
	enable it as per iio-binding.txt.

	io-channels = <&ina3221x INA3221_CHAN_INDEX(0, CURRENT, NORMAL)>;
	io-channel-names = "battery-current";

	Here iio-channel name for battry current is "battery-current".

Vbus input power monitoring:
        Driver supports the vbus input power monitoring through IIO interface
        and if platform supports it then following properties are required to
        enable it as per iio-binding.txt.

        io-channels = <&ina3221x INA3221_CHAN_INDEX(1, POWER, NORMAL)>;
        io-channel-names = "vbus-input-power";

        Here iio-channel name for battry current is "vbus-input-power".

Example:

	bq27441@55 {
		compatible = "ti,bq27441";
		ti,design-capacity = <7800>;
		ti,design-energy = <28314>;
		ti,taper-rate = <167>;
		ti,terminate-voltage = <3150>;
		ti,v-at-chg-term = <4200>;
		ti,tz-name = "battery-temp";
		ti,kernel-threshold-soc = <5>;
		ti,kernel-maximum-soc = <99>;
	};
