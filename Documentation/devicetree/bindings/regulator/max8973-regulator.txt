* Maxim MAX8973 Voltage Regulator

Required properties:

- compatible:	must be one of following:
			"maxim,max8973"
			"maxim,max77621".
- reg:		the i2c slave address of the regulator. It should be 0x1b.

Any standard regulator properties can be used to configure the single max8973
DCDC.

Optional properties:
- interrupts: Interrupt number can be provided as detailed on
	Documentation/devicetree/bindings/interrupt-controller/interrupts.txt
- interrupt-flags: Provide interrupt flags as per
	include/dt-bindings/interrupt-controller/irq.h.
-maxim,externally-enable: boolean, externally control the regulator output
		enable/disable.
-maxim,enable-gpio: GPIO for enable control. If the valid GPIO is provided
		then externally enable control will be considered.
-maxim,dvs-gpio: GPIO which is connected to DVS pin of device.
-maxim,dvs-default-state: Default state of GPIO during initialisation.
		1 for HIGH and 0 for LOW.
- maxim,sleep-on-dvs: Boolean, enable sleep control through DVS pin. When
		this property is available then property dvs-default-state
		will tell dvs pin state for active state of the rail.
- maxim,junction-temp-warning: Junction temp thrshold for which warnign
		generated. This is milli-celcius like for 120degC, it is
		120000.
-maxim,enable-remote-sense: boolean, enable reote sense.
-maxim,enable-falling-slew-rate: boolean, enable falling slew rate.
-maxim,enable-active-discharge: boolean: enable active discharge.
-maxim,enable-frequency-shift: boolean, enable 9% frequency shift.
-maxim,enable-bias-control: boolean, enable bias control. By enabling this
		startup delay can be reduce to 20us from 220us.

Example:

	max8973@1b {
		compatible = "maxim,max8973";
		reg = <0x1b>;

		regulator-min-microvolt = <935000>;
		regulator-max-microvolt = <1200000>;
		regulator-boot-on;
		regulator-always-on;
	};
