* Tegra Hypervisor Serial emulation (tegra_hv_comm)

Required properties:
- compatible: Should be "nvidia,tegra-hv-comm"
- ivc: Should contain a tuple containing a reference to the tegra hypervisor
  node and an index of the IVC channel to use

Additional considerations:
- Each IVC frame containing serial data is processed from uninterruptible
  (atomic) context. This means that use of large frame sizes will potentially
  decrease overall system responsiveness to interrupts.
- The recommended frame size is 64 (the default configuration.)

Example:
	tegra_hv_comm {
		compatible = "nvidia,tegra-hv-comm";
		status = "okay";
		ivc = <&tegra_hv 1>;
	};
