/**
 * struct nvs_proximity - the common structure between the
 * proximity driver and the NVS common module for proximity.
 * @timestamp: Driver writes the timestamp HW was read.
 * @timestamp_report: NVS writes the timestamp used to report.
 * @proximity: NVS writes the proximity value that is reported.
 * @hw: Driver writes the value read from HW.
 * @hw_mask: Driver writes the HW value mask (maximum value).
 * @hw_thresh_lo: NVS writes the low threshold value needed.
 * @hw_thresh_hi: NVS writes the high threshold value needed.
 * @hw_limit_lo: NVS determines if HW at low limit.  Driver can
 *               use this for dynamic resolution if disabled in
 *               NVS.  See nld_tbl.
 * @hw_limit_hi: NVS determines if HW at high limit.  Driver can
 *               use this for dynamic resolution if disabled in
 *               NVS.  See nld_tbl.
 * @thresh_valid_lo: NVS determines if cfg.thresh_lo valid.
 * @thresh_valid_hi: NVS determines if cfg.thresh_hi valid.
 * @thresholds_valid: NVS determines if both thresholds valid.
 * @proximity_binary_en: NVS determines if binary reporting is
 *                       enabled.
 * @proximity_binary_en: NVS determines if HW binary reporting is
 *                       enabled via device tree, or driver enables
 *                       this by setting hw_mask to 1.
 * @calibration_en: NVS determines if calibration is enabled.
 * @poll_delay_ms: NVS writes the poll time needed if polling.
 * @delay_us: Driver writes the requested sample time.
 * @report: NVS writes the report count.
 * @cfg: Driver writes the sensor_cfg structure pointer.
 * @nvs_data: Driver writes the private pointer for handler.
 * @handler: Driver writes the handler pointer.
