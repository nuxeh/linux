This release is based on the v4.2/rcar-3.0.x branch from the 
git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/horms/renesas-bsp.git
as the current upstream does not have as many features enabled yet.

There have been a couple of fixes to ensure the H3 build works on the
H3 Salvator-X board. The framebuffer blank code caused an OOPS due to
several functions failing to check for a NULL setting and to ensure
the kernel works when just the Renesas SoCs are selected.

Notes:

Due to issues with console blanking, it is recommended that the console
blanking is turned off with the kernel command line paramter "consoleblank=0"

Known issues:

Audio has yet to be succesfully tested due to issues with the rcar-dma driver
failing.

To build:

export CROSS_COMPILE=aarch64-linux-gnu-
export ARCH=arm64
make h3_defconfig
make -j8 Image

To boot (via u-boot):

# change these network settings to ones appropriate for the board
setenv ethaddr 2e:09:0a:00:9f:9f; setenv netmask 255.255.0.0
setenv ipaddr 10.24.102.99; setenv serverip 10.24.1.119

# set to boot from sata or usb device
setenv bootargs console=ttySC0,115200 mem=2048M root=/dev/sda1 rootwait

# copy slav.img (arch/arm64/boot/Image) to tftp server
# copy r8a7795-salvator-x.dtb (arch/arm64/boot/dts/renesas/r8a7795-salvator-x.dtb) to tftp server

tftp 0x48080000 salv.img; tftp 0x48000000 r8a7795-salvator-x.dtb; booti 0x48080000 - 0x48000000
