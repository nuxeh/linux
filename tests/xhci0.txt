XHCI 0 (Host)
=============

Driver module requires firmware, so the xhci driver is built as a module
and loaded via automatic module loading once the root filesystem is loaded.

Notes
-----

U11 provides the two USB channel clocks at 100MHz differential.
X6 provides 50MHz clock for usb system.

Both clocks are active when the driver is started (as verified by an
oscilloscope)
